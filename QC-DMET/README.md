Building and testing
--------------------

QC-DMET requires python, numpy, scipy, cmake,
[chemps2](https://github.com/SebWouters/CheMPS2), and
[pyscf](https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf).

The paths to the folders in which PyCheMPS2.so and pyscf
are installed can be adjusted in [qcdmet_paths.py](src/qcdmet_paths.py).

Go to the folder lib and compile libqcdmet.so:

    > cd lib
    > mkdir build
    > cd build
    > CXX=icpc CC=icc cmake .. -DMKL=ON
    > make
    > cd ../..

Start from the files examples/*.py.

Performance testing
-------------------

### 1. Find the most costly functions:

    > python -m cProfile -o testx.profile testx.py
    > python -m pstats testx.profile
    >>> sort cumulative
    >>> stats

### 2. Find what makes them most costly:

Place just before the function you want to profile @profile:

    @profile
    def construct1RDM_loc_response( self, doSCF, umat, list_H1 ):

And then use [line_profiler](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler):

    > kernprof -lv testx.py
